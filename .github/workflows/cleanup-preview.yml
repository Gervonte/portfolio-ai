              The preview branch has been automatically reset to match \`main\` after successful merge.

              **What happened:**
              - Preview branch was reset to match main exactly
              - All old merge commits were removed
              - Preview branch is now clean and ready for new features

              **Next steps:**
              - Create new feature branches from \`preview\`
              - Preview branch will stay clean for future deployments

              ---
              *This cleanup was performed automatically by GitHub Actions*`
            });
