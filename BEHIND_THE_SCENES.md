# Behind the Scenes Project Details

This document describes the implementation of expandable project cards with behind-the-scenes technical details, as outlined in the roadmap.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Modal-Based Technical Details

- Clean project cards with "View Technical Details" button
- Modal overlay for detailed technical information
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility support

### ✅ Technical Details Panel

- Tabbed interface for different technical aspects:
  - **Analytics** - User engagement and performance metrics
  - **Monitoring** - Error tracking and system health
  - **CI/CD** - Deployment pipeline and automation
  - **Performance** - Lighthouse scores and Core Web Vitals
  - **Architecture** - System design and components

### ✅ Interactive Elements

- Lightbox gallery for technical screenshots
- Hover effects and click-to-zoom functionality
- Progress bars for performance metrics
- Badge displays for tools and technologies

### ✅ Data Structure

Extended `projects-metadata.json` with comprehensive technical details:

```json
{
  "technicalDetails": {
    "analytics": {
      "screenshots": ["analytics-dashboard.png"],
      "description": "Real-time user engagement metrics",
      "metrics": {
        "pageViews": "1,200+",
        "bounceRate": "45%",
        "avgSessionDuration": "2m 30s"
      }
    },
    "monitoring": {
      "tools": ["Vercel Analytics", "GitHub Actions"],
      "uptime": "99.9%",
      "errorRate": "< 0.1%"
    },
    "cicd": {
      "workflows": ["CI/CD Pipeline", "Security Scanning"],
      "deploymentFrequency": "Multiple times per day"
    },
    "performance": {
      "lighthouseScore": 92,
      "coreWebVitals": {
        "LCP": "1.2s",
        "FID": "45ms",
        "CLS": "0.05"
      }
    },
    "architecture": {
      "components": ["Next.js App Router", "Mantine UI"],
      "deployment": "Vercel with CDN"
    }
  }
}
```

## Components

### `ExpandableProjectCard`

Main project card component that handles:

- Card display with project information
- Modal trigger for technical details
- Visual styling based on project type (vibe-coded vs standard-work)
- Hover effects and interactions

### `TechnicalDetailsModal`

Modal component featuring:

- Tabbed navigation between technical sections
- Dynamic content rendering based on data structure
- Image gallery with lightbox functionality
- Metrics visualization with progress bars and grids
- Project links and external references

## Usage

The project cards are automatically integrated into the WorkSection component. Users can:

1. **View Project Overview** - See basic project information, technologies, and achievements
2. **Open Technical Details** - Click "View Technical Details" to open a modal with behind-the-scenes information
3. **Navigate Tabs** - Switch between Analytics, Monitoring, CI/CD, Performance, and Architecture
4. **View Screenshots** - Click on technical screenshots to open them in a lightbox
5. **Close Modal** - Click outside the modal or the close button to return to the project view

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

- Uses React `useState` for modal open/close state
- Local state for active tab selection
- Modal state for image lightbox

### Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of technical content (only loads when modal opens)
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized image loading with fallbacks

### Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Screen reader friendly structure
- Focus management for modal content

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-optimized modal view
- Flexible grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Proper spacing and typography scaling

## Future Enhancements

### Content Strategy

- Capture real analytics dashboard screenshots
- Document actual CI/CD pipeline workflows
- Create system architecture diagrams
- Include before/after performance comparisons

### Technical Improvements

- Add more interactive visualizations
- Implement data export functionality
- Add search/filter capabilities
- Create print-friendly views
