## Decision Rationale

### Included in Skills Section

- **Core resume skills** - All skills from the parsed resume are included
- **Vercel & Sentry** - Added as they are actively used in current projects and represent important DevOps skills

### Not Included in Skills Section

- **Project-specific libraries** - Tools like Mantine UI, Chakra UI, Framer Motion are project-specific and don't represent core skills
- **Research tools** - Jupyter, Pandas, Scikit-learn are research-specific and not part of the main professional skillset
- **AI tools** - OpenAI API, Gemini API are tools used for research, not core development skills
- **Specialized libraries** - Essentia.js, Web Audio API are very specific to audio processing

## Future Considerations

### Potential Additions

- **Next.js** - Could be added as it's a significant framework used in the main portfolio
- **Docker** - Could be added if the level is upgraded from "basic" to "intermediate" or higher

### Categories to Consider

- **Tools** - Could add a "Development Tools" category for things like Zod, Resend
- **Soft Skills** - Could add soft skills if they become relevant to the professional profile
