# Projects Metadata

This directory contains the metadata files for the portfolio's work section.

## Files

- `projects-metadata.json` - Main projects data file
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## How to Update Projects

To add, edit, or remove projects from the work section:

1. **Edit `projects-metadata.json`** - This is the main data file
2. **No code changes needed** - The WorkSection component automatically reads from this file
3. **Restart the dev server** - Run `npm run dev` to see changes

## Project Structure

Each project in the `projects` array should have:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-project-id",
  "title": "Project Name",
  "description": "Short description",
  "longDescription": "Detailed description",
  "type": "vibe-coded" | "standard-work",
  "technologies": ["Tech1", "Tech2", "Tech3"],
  "status": "completed" | "in-progress" | "planned",
  "featured": true | false,
  "liveUrl": "https://example.com",
  "githubUrl": "https://github.com/user/repo",
  "achievements": ["Achievement 1", "Achievement 2"],
  "aiTools": ["AI Tool 1", "AI Tool 2"], // Only for vibe-coded projects
  "timeline": "Time period",
  "category": "Category Name"
}
```

## Project Types
